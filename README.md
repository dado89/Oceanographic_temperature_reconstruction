# The project in short
The aim of the project is to combine: 
- ocean temperature outputs of the climate simulator HadCM3; and  
- proxy data for ocean temperature (kindly provided by Prof Harry Dowsett - U.S. Geological Survey);

to carry out a data-model comparison of sea-surface temperature during the mid Pliocene Warm Period, by accounting for the variability induced by orbital parameter changes.
A PCA approach in combination with Gaussian process emulation is used to tackle the task. 

# Code
The description of the different functions can be found inside each script.

# Also present
Some plots of emulated mean and variance of annual average temperature, compared with proxy data.
