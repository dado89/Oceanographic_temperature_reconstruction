# The project in short
Combining climate computer models (HadCM3) and proxy data for temperature (kindly provided by Prof Harry Dowsett - U.S. Geological Survey) to reconstruct the sea-surface temperature during the mid Pliocene Warm Period, and carry out a data-model comparison.

# Code
The description of the different functions can be found inside each script.

# Also present
Some plots of emulated mean and variance of annual average temperature, compared with proxy data.
